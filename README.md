## House Price Predictor

I like to expand my familiarity with technology outside my core skills to stay up to date. I took a short course on TensorFlow to familiarize myself with the statistical techniques used in machine learning. Here is the final exercise in this course, included here for anyone interested in taking a look at a real example of a TF program. 


Built for Python 3. Uses TensorFlow Library. Installation instructions can be found at [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

Just run!
```
python3 house-price-predictor.py
```


Based on Jerry Kurata's Pluralsight tutorial "TensorFlow: Getting Started"
